  Runs an integration test by creating a KIND cluster and executing it as a Go
  test.

  Uses the machine executor and replaces the Go version with a version
  controlled by us since the preinstalled Go is very outdated.

  Tests can be customized by providing a KIND config file or a setup script
  which is run before the test is executed.
