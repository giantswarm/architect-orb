  It does everything that go-test
  (https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/giantswarm/architect#jobs-go-test)
  job does and runs `go build` against the codebase on top of that. It injects
  all the variables go-test job does into the produced binary.

  The job produces static binary named after the repository name. It is
  persisted to workspace under "./" path.
#
# Job: go-build
#
# This job runs go-test and then builds a Go binary for the specified architecture using the go-build command.
# If the architecture is set (e.g., linux/amd64), the binary will be named <binary>-<GOOS>-<GOARCH> and, if linux/amd64, also as <binary>.
# All produced binaries are persisted to the workspace.
#
# Parameters:
#   binary: Name of the binary produced by the job. It is also persisted to the workspace.
#   architecture: Target architecture for Go build (e.g., "linux/amd64", "linux/arm64", or "darwin/amd64"). Default: linux/amd64.
#   os: (Deprecated) Use architecture instead for multi-arch support.
#   path: Path where the Go package to build is located (default: ".").
#   pre_test_target: Makefile target to run before lints and tests (optional).
#   resource_class: CircleCI resource class for the job.
#   test_target: Makefile target to run for tests (optional).
#   tags: Additional Go build tags (optional).
#
# Behavior:
#   - Runs go-build command with all parameters.
#   - Persists all binaries (including multi-arch and default) to the workspace.
